    line: So, what's up with those asteroids?
  - character: 11
    line: So much, man, so much.
  - character: 11
    line: They cause electromagnetic fields fluctuations on impact.
  - character: 11
    line: Have you seen sparkling asteroids in space?
  - character: 9
    line: Yeah, a couple of times.
  - character: 11
    line: That's what I'm talking about.
  - character: 11
    line: But I can't quite replicate that effect in the lab.
  - character: 11
    line: Listen, do you have a model of Catcher with stasis?
  - character: 9
    line: With what?
  - character: 11
    line: Apparently not. 
  - character: 11
    line: Stasis spheres. It's a new development. They protect the object from external influences, slow down the processes inside. 
  - character: 11
    line: Perhaps stasis can preserve the effect I'm interested in.
  - character: 9
    line: Well, what am I supposed to do?
  - character: 11
    line: First of all, here's the new Catcher.
  - character: 11
    line: It's got stasis, and it can hold up to 15 objects.
  - character: 11
    line: Second, go get me five sparkling asteroids.
  - character: 11
    line: And hurry, we don't know how long they'll spark after the storm!
